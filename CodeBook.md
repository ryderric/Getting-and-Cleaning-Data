The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation followed by the steps necessary to meet the course projectâ€™s definition.

1. Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted in the folder named UCI HAR Dataset

2 Read data into dataframes
* features <- features.txt - acceleromete and gyroscope measurements
* activities <- activity_labels.txt - activities performed by volunteers
* s_test <- test/subject_test.txt - test data for volunteers
* x_test <- test/X_test.txt - recorded test data for features
* y_test <- test/y_test.txt  - recorded test data for activity codes
* s_train <- test/subject_train.txt - training data for volunteers
* x_train <- test/X_train.txt - recorded training data for features
* y_train <- test/y_train.txt - recorded training data for activity codes

3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
* x is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
* y is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
* s is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
* knitdata is created by merging S, Y and X using cbind() function

4. Extract the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

5. Update names to provide more descriptice variable names:
* Added titles to activities column
* All variables starting with the character f is updated to Frequency
* All variables starting the character t is updated with Time
* Acc is replaced with Accelerometer
* Gyro is replaced with Gyroscope
* BodyBody is replaced with Body
* Mag is replaced with Magnitude

6. Create the tidyData_set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
